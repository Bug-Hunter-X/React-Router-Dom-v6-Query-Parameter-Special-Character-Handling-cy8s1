In React Router Dom v6, navigating to a route with a query parameter that contains special characters (like '+' or '/') can cause unexpected behavior or prevent the navigation from working correctly.  The issue stems from how the router parses and handles these characters in the URL.  For example, if you try to navigate to `/search?query=hello+world`, the '+' might be misinterpreted.

```javascript
//Incorrect Navigation
navigate('/search?query=hello+world');
```
